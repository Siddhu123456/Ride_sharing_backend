*what are java streams?
	 Streams represent pipeline through which data will flow and streams will perform various operations on that data inorder to    transform the data.

Streams contains intermediate operations and a terminal operation that give the output.

-> Streams are lazy in nature . Intermediate operations just create the pipeline, the created pipeline is triggered by the Terminal operation to give output.
